# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS”

&emsp;**Event Name:** AWS AI/ML & Generative AI Workshop

&emsp;**Date:** September 18, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** 2 Hai Trieu Street, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City

&emsp;**Role in the Event:** Attendee

## Event Objectives

The workshop's primary goals were to introduce participants to the full spectrum of AI/ML services on AWS and equip them with practical skills in Generative AI implementation.

**ML Lifecycle Mastery:** Equip developers with skills in the end-to-end ML lifecycle, covering data preparation, deployment, and Integrated MLOps capabilities using **Amazon SageMaker**.

**Generative AI Fundamentals:** Introduce core Generative AI concepts, including **Foundation Models** (comparison/selection guide), **Prompt Engineering**, and **RAG architecture**.

**Practical Implementation:** Demonstrate practical GenAI implementation, safety (Guardrails), and multi-step workflow tool integration using **Amazon Bedrock Agents**.

**Market Overview:** Provide an overview of the AI/ML landscape in Vietnam and establish learning objectives.

### Key Highlights

#### End-to-End ML Platform (Amazon SageMaker)

- Platform Overview: Comprehensive coverage of SageMaker as the end-to-end ML platform on AWS.
- Core Capabilities: Focus on essential steps:
  - Data preparation and labeling 
  - Model training, tuning, and deployment 
  - Integrated MLOps capabilities 
  - Practical Exposure: Live Demo: SageMaker Studio walkthrough  

#### Generative AI Core Concepts (Amazon Bedrock)

- **Foundation Models:** Review and comparison guide for models such as Claude, Llama, and Titan.

- **Prompt Engineering:** Deep dive into advanced techniques:
  - Chain-of-Thought reasoning
  - Few-shot learning

- **Advanced Architecture**:
  - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Architecture and Knowledge Base integration
  - **Bedrock Agents:** Multi-step workflows and tool integrations
  - **Safety:** Implementation of Guardrails for safety and content filtering

- **Final Demo:** Live demonstration: Building a Generative AI chatbot using Bedrock

## Key Takeaways

### Design Mindset

- **Model Selection Criteria:** Prioritize selecting the correct Foundation Model based on comprehensive comparison and selection guides  
- **Safety First:** Understand the necessity of implementing **Guardrails** for content filtering and ensuring safety in all GenAI applications  
 
### Modernization Strategy

- **MLOps Integration:** Modernization requires integrating MLOps capabilities for continuous deployment and monitoring of ML models[cite: 1].

### Applying to Work

1. **Master Prompt Engineering:** Apply **Chain-of-Thought reasoning** and **Few-shot learning** techniques to boost the accuracy and quality of prompts for current GenAI pilots.
2. **Pilot RAG Architecture:** Initiate planning for **RAG architecture** to ground current models on internal data, moving beyond simple prompts.
3. **Utilize SageMaker E2E:** Integrate SageMaker for the full ML lifecycle, from data prep through deployment, to ensure MLOps best practices are followed.

## Event Experience

Attending the **AWS AI/ML & Generative AI Workshop** was extremely valuable, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of machine learning and GenAI capabilities on the AWS platform.

- **Applied Learning:** The session provided crucial clarity on the distinction and usage between the traditional ML platform (SageMaker) and the new Generative AI platform (Bedrock).
- **Technical Exposure:** Deep technical insights were gained, particularly regarding the architecture of **RAG** and the practical application of **Prompt Engineering**.
- **Demos & Actionable Steps:** The live demonstrations of the SageMaker Studio walkthrough and the Bedrock Chatbot building session provided immediate, actionable templates for future project development.

### Lessons Learned

- **Guardrails are Essential:** Safety and content filtering tools must be integrated into every Bedrock deployment.
- **Prompt Engineering is Code:** Mastering advanced prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought is critical for high-quality, reliable GenAI output.
- **SageMaker for Control:** SageMaker remains the standard platform for end-to-end control over the classical ML lifecycle.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the workshop successfully demonstrated the current best practices for both traditional and Generative AI, providing a clear technical roadmap for integrating these advanced services into modern applications.
