### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
I found the working environment to be exceptionally positive. The workspace was spacious and comfortable, fostering a productive atmosphere. Furthermore, my colleagues were very friendly, and the mentors were highly enthusiastic and supportive, always guiding us whenever we had questions and providing substantial assistance throughout the program.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The level of support received from my mentor and the team administrator was exceptionally high. My mentor was highly enthusiastic and constantly available, providing dedicated guidance on complex technical issues related to cloud architecture and backend implementation. Their commitment went beyond supervision; they actively fostered a productive learning environment, offered valuable resources, and provided substantial support whenever required, significantly accelerating my progress throughout the internship.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
While the internship provided some opportunities to apply foundational knowledge from my academic major in Information Security, I was exposed to a vast amount of new technical content, particularly in web development and specialized cloud services, which were not covered in my school curriculum. Consequently, I sometimes felt slower in grasping certain concepts compared to other peers participating in the training program.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
As noted above, because I was constantly exposed to entirely new technical domains and subject matter, the opportunities for profound learning and accelerated personal skill development were immense and highly valuable throughout the internship period.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture fostered a remarkable sense of collaboration and mentorship. My colleagues were friendly, and the mentors were genuinely enthusiastic in supporting the interns. The overall spirit of the team was consistently passionate, driven by a collective eagerness to learn and actively contribute to the project goals.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The internship policies and overall support were highly satisfactory. We were consistently encouraged to comfortably seek clarification and ask questions regarding any complex issues or remaining doubts. The proactive encouragement and detailed guidance from the mentors were structured to maximize learning and significantly accelerated my growth during the program.
