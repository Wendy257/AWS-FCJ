During my internship at **AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED** from 08-09-2025 to 12-12-2025, I had the opportunity to apply my academic knowledge in a real professional environment and gain valuable hands-on experience.

During this period, I participated in a web development project focused on building an online jewelry store, where I was responsible for tasks such as designing core features, implementing backend functions, and improving the user interface. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in web programming, first time learning C# programming language, English skill, teamwork, and interpersonal communication.

In terms of work ethic, I consistently aimed to complete tasks with high quality, adhered to workplace guidelines, and collaborated actively with colleagues to support a productive and positive working environment.
