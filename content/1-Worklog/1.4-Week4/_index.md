### Week 4 Objectives:

* **EC2 Core Competency:** Define EC2 concepts including Instance Types, AMIs, and Hypervisors (Nitro).
* **Storage Differentiation:** Distinguish between EBS (persistent, snapshot-backed) and Instance Store (ephemeral, high IOPS).
* **Instance Automation:** Utilize User Data for bootstrapping scripts and Metadata to retrieve instance information.
* **Scaling & Cost Optimization:** Implement Auto Scaling for high availability and select appropriate Pricing Options (On-demand, Reserved, Spot).
* **Lightsail Usage:** Recognize Amazon Lightsail as a low-cost, fixed-price solution for lightweight workloads.

### Week 4 Achievements:

* Launched and managed EC2 instances with bootstrapping via User Data.
* Performed EBS volume operations including attachment, expansion, and snapshot creation.
* Built a Highly Available architecture using Auto Scaling Groups and Application Load Balancers.
* Evaluated when to use Spot Instances vs. On-Demand for cost savings.
